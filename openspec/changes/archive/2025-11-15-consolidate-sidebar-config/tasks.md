## 1. Cleanup
- [x] 1.1 Remove `navConfigV2.ts` and delete the feature flag logic in `Sidebar.tsx` so it always uses a single config.
- [x] 1.2 Rename `navConfigV1.ts` to `navConfig.ts` and update imports throughout the project.

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Run `npm run lint` (or targeted checks) to ensure the refactor passes.
