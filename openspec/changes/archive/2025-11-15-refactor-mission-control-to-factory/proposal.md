# Change: Refactor Mission Control Pages to use ResourcePageFactory

## Why
The pages under `src/app/(dashboard)/(mission-control)` are built manually, while the newer pages under `src/app/(dashboard)/resources` use the superior `ResourcePageFactory` pattern. This inconsistency creates two different ways of building resource pages, which increases maintenance overhead, code duplication, and developer confusion—across Mission Control’s App Runtime, Platform, and Infra sections. In addition, Mission Control contains a handful of bespoke health/diagnostics pages (e.g., Events, AI alerts) that should be explicitly called out so the refactor doesn’t accidentally remove their functionality.

Adopting the factory pattern everywhere will enforce consistency, reduce boilerplate, and make the Mission Control section as maintainable and extensible as the Resources section.

## What Changes
- Refactor the existing resource list pages in `(mission-control)` (App Runtime, Platform, and Infra) to be generated by the `ResourcePageFactory` component, while leaving bespoke health pages (e.g., `/events`, `/ai-diagnosis`) untouched but explicitly documented as exceptions.
- Create `ResourcePageConfig` configurations for each resource type currently in Mission Control (Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Services, Ingresses, PVCs, PVs, Nodes, Namespaces, etc.), preserving the existing functionality, columns, filters, and mission-control-specific adornments (like quick actions).
- Where Mission Control adds extra UI (diagnosis buttons, health summaries), ensure the factory config exposes escape hatches so those additions remain intact.
- This change does not alter the UI, but unifies the underlying implementation and documents any intentional deviations.

## Impact
- **Specs**: `console-ui` spec will be updated to mandate that all resource list views SHOULD use a factory pattern for consistency.
- **Code**: All page files under `src/app/(dashboard)/(mission-control)/**` will be refactored. New configuration files for the factory might be created.
- **Risk**: Low to Medium. The refactoring is internal and uses a well-established pattern (`ResourcePageFactory`) already present in the codebase. The main risk is ensuring that no functionality is lost during the migration of each page.
